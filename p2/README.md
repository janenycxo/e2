## Game planning
+ Rock/Paper/Scissors Multiplayer Game
+ The rules of the game is pretty simple. There are three shapes thrown by hand.
+ ROCK is when you hold your hand in a fist. 
+ PAPER is when you hold your hand out in the high five sign. 
+ SCISSORS is when you position your pointer and middle finger in a peace sign.
+ ROCK beats SCISSORS, SCISSORS beat PAPER, and PAPER beats ROCK.

+ This game is played by throwing out these hand signs.
+ On the count of three, or by chanting rock/paper/scissor all hands must be thrown in unison every single time to avoid room for error. No slow throwing allowed.
